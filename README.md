# PRODIGY_DS_2
A repository filled with tasks I have completed as a Data Science Intern at Prodigy Infotech

Task 2 : 
Performing Data Cleaning and EDA using Titanic survivorship dataset from Kaggle
Titanic which was considered unsinkable had pummeled to the waters killing many on board.
Through this task, I was able to understand relationship between survival rate, age and sex among the survivors from the biggest shipwreck of all time that shook the history of the world.
